🧩 Phase 1: Feature Pipeline (Hourly) ✅ COMPLETED

Goal: Turn raw API data into features stored in BigQuery with auto-sync to Vertex AI Feature Store.

✅ IMPLEMENTED STEPS:

✅ feature_pipeline.py - Complete implementation:
- Fetches current data from AQICN API
- Extracts useful fields (AQI, pm25, pm10, timestamp, etc.)
- Computes time-based features: hour, day, month, year, day_of_week
- Computes derived features: entity_id, feature_timestamp (for Feature Store)
- Saves directly to BigQuery table with proper schema
- Auto-syncs to Vertex AI Feature Store
- Includes duplicate prevention and error handling

✅ BigQuery Integration:
- Table: aqi_dataset.aqi_features (partitioned by timestamp)
- Schema: 20+ columns including all features
- Proper TIMESTAMP handling for time-series data
- Partition-aware queries for performance

✅ Schema Management:
- Migration scripts for adding new columns
- Partition filter compliance for BigQuery updates
- Proper data type handling (INTEGER, TIMESTAMP, STRING)

✅ Configuration & Authentication:
- Service account authentication
- Centralized config.py
- Environment variable management

🎯 CURRENT STATUS: Phase 1 is production-ready and tested

🧠 Phase 2: Training Pipeline (Daily) ✅ COMPLETED

Goal: Retrain your model automatically every day using updated features from BigQuery/Feature Store.

✅ IMPLEMENTED STEPS:

✅ training_pipeline.py - Complete implementation:
- Loads dataset from BigQuery table with proper time-based filtering
- Creates multi-horizon targets (24h, 48h, 72h ahead predictions)
- Trains multiple models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
- Evaluates using RMSE, MAE, R², MAPE metrics
- Saves best models → Vertex AI Model Registry with proper directory structure
- Includes model versioning, metadata tracking, and performance history

✅ KEY FEATURES IMPLEMENTED:
- ✅ Proper GCS directory structure for Model Registry compatibility
- ✅ Built-in Vertex AI containers (sklearn-cpu, xgboost-cpu)
- ✅ Temporal train/test splits maintaining time order
- ✅ Feature importance analysis and visualization
- ✅ Model performance tracking and comparison
- ✅ Automated model upload to Vertex AI Model Registry
- ✅ Model metadata and versioning system
- ✅ Performance monitoring and evaluation metrics

🎯 CURRENT STATUS: Phase 2 is production-ready and tested

🔧 RECENT FIXES (Model Registry Integration):
- ✅ Fixed GCS directory structure (models now upload as directories, not single files)
- ✅ Resolved Vertex AI Model Registry compatibility issues
- ✅ Simplified architecture (removed custom predictor directory)
- ✅ Built-in containers now handle model serving automatically
- ✅ Feature Store is auto-syncing
- ✅ Data schema is stable and well-defined

⚙️ Phase 3: Automation (CI/CD) ✅ PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED

Goal: Automate both pipelines using GitHub Actions.

✅ IMPLEMENTED:
- GitHub Actions workflows created
- Feature pipeline automation (hourly schedule)
- Training pipeline automation (daily schedule)
- GitHub Secrets configuration for secure credential storage
- Manual workflow triggers for testing

✅ WORKFLOWS CREATED:
- `.github/workflows/feature-pipeline.yml` - Hourly feature ingestion
- `.github/workflows/training-pipeline.yml` - Daily model training
- Proper permissions and authentication setup
- Error handling and logging

🎯 CURRENT STATUS:
- ✅ Feature pipeline automation is ready
- 🚧 Training pipeline automation (pending Phase 2 completion)
- ✅ Manual testing capabilities available

🌐 Phase 4: Web App / Dashboard 📋 FUTURE

Goal: Show your predictions interactively using the trained models.

📋 PLANNED IMPLEMENTATION:

Framework: Streamlit (chosen for simplicity and ML integration)

App Features:
- Load latest model from Vertex AI Model Registry
- Pull most recent features from Feature Store
- Run model.predict() for next 3 days/hourly forecasts
- Display AQI forecast + trend charts
- Add alerts for hazardous levels (red/yellow indicators)
- Real-time data visualization

Deployment: Streamlit Cloud or Vercel

🎯 PREREQUISITES:
- ✅ Phase 2: Training pipeline with model registry
- ✅ Stable feature pipeline (completed)

- Programmatic setup beats UI limitations
- Proper error handling and logging essential

### Development Process
- Test locally before automating
- Use migration scripts for schema changes
- Document troubleshooting steps for future reference


## Training Approach
### Week 1 (Now - 50 records):
Build baseline model without lags
Learn model training, evaluation, deployment
Document performance: "With limited data, achieved X accuracy"
### Week 2 (168+ records):
Add lag features
Compare performance improvement
Show learning: "Adding temporal features improved accuracy by Y%"
### Week 3+ (500+ records):
Add advanced features (rolling statistics, trend indicators)
Experiment with XGBoost, LSTM
Production-ready model
