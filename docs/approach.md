🧩 Phase 1: Feature Pipeline (Hourly)

Goal: Turn raw API data into features stored in a Feature Store (or even a CSV/DB to start).

Steps:

Write your feature script (feature_pipeline.py):

Fetch current data from AQICN API.

Extract useful fields (AQI, pm25, pm10, timestamp, etc.).

Compute features:

Time-based → hour, day, month, weekday.

Derived → AQI change rate, rolling averages (you can start simple first).

Append new records to your Feature Store.

If you’re just prototyping → use a CSV, Parquet, or SQLite DB as feature store.

Later, move to Hopsworks or Vertex AI.

Run this script manually first to confirm it appends new data every hour correctly.

🧠 Phase 2: Training Pipeline (Daily)

Goal: Retrain your model automatically every day using updated features.

Steps:

Write train_pipeline.py:

Load your full dataset from Feature Store.

Split into train/test based on time.

Train model(s): RandomForest, RidgeRegression, etc.

Evaluate using RMSE, MAE, R².

Save the best model → Model Registry (start with local directory; later use MLflow or Hopsworks).

Validate that retraining works on existing data first (no CI/CD yet).

⚙️ Phase 3: Automation (CI/CD)

Goal: Automate both pipelines.

Tool: Start with GitHub Actions (simpler than Airflow).

Schedule jobs:

Hourly run → feature_pipeline.py.

Daily run → train_pipeline.py.

Use GitHub Secrets to store your API key safely.

Push logs / results to GitHub repo or a cloud storage bucket.

Later, you can migrate to Airflow if you want to demonstrate enterprise-grade orchestration.

🌐 Phase 4: Web App / Dashboard

Goal: Show your predictions interactively.

Framework options: Streamlit or Gradio (both easy, fast).

App loads the latest model from the model folder/registry.

Pulls the most recent features from your store.

Runs model.predict() for next 3 days (or next few hours).

Displays AQI forecast + trend chart.

Optional: Add alerts for hazardous levels (e.g., red/yellow indicators).

Deploy it serverlessly (e.g., Streamlit Cloud, Hugging Face Spaces, or Vercel).

🚀 Phase 5: Continuous Improvement

Integrate SHAP/LIME for explainability.

Add notifications/alerts when AQI crosses thresholds.

Keep CI/CD running in background to grow your dataset automatically.
