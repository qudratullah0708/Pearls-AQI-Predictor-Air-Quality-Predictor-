# 🎯 Data Synchronization: Presentation Summary

## 📋 Executive Summary

**Challenge:** GitHub Actions collects hourly AQI data but stores it in ephemeral runners. Local development needs access to this accumulated data for model training.

**Solution:** GitHub Actions Artifacts with intelligent sync strategies and automation scripts.

**Impact:** Enables seamless data flow between CI/CD and local development, supporting the complete ML pipeline.

## 🔍 Problem Analysis

### The Core Issue
```
GitHub Actions (Cloud)          Local Development (Laptop)
┌─────────────────────┐        ┌─────────────────────┐
│ Hourly Pipeline     │        │ Model Training      │
│ • Collects AQI data │        │ • Needs historical  │
│ • Stores in Feast   │   ❌   │   data (72+ hours)  │
│ • Runner destroyed  │        │ • No data access    │
└─────────────────────┘        └─────────────────────┘
```

### Why This Matters
- **Model Training:** Requires 72+ hours of data for 72h predictions
- **Development:** Need fresh data for testing and validation
- **Learning:** Understanding data patterns over time
- **Production:** Real-world MLOps challenge

## 🛠️ Solution Exploration Journey

### Approach 1: Commit Data to Git ❌
**Idea:** Have CI commit updated parquet files to repository
**Why Rejected:**
- Repository bloat (binary files)
- Git history pollution
- Merge conflicts
- Performance issues

### Approach 2: Cloud Storage (S3/R2/GCS) ⚠️
**Idea:** Use cloud object storage as shared backend
**Why Deferred:**
- Authentication complexity
- Additional dependencies
- Over-engineering for current scope

### Approach 3: Database Solutions ⚠️
**Idea:** PostgreSQL (Render) or Redis (Upstash)
**Why Deferred:**
- Schema migration complexity
- Learning overhead
- Overkill for simple time-series data

### Approach 4: GitHub Actions Artifacts ✅
**Idea:** Use built-in artifact storage
**Why Chosen:**
- ✅ Free and included
- ✅ No setup required
- ✅ Perfect fit for use case
- ✅ Easy to implement

## ⚡ Implementation Details

### Core Components

#### 1. Workflow Artifact Upload
```yaml
- name: Upload Feast offline artifacts
  if: success()
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: feast-offline-store-${{ github.run_number }}
    path: |
      feature_repo/data/aqi_features.parquet
      feature_repo/data/registry.db
    retention-days: 30
```

#### 2. Python Sync Script (`sync_feast_data.py`)
**Key Functions:**
- `get_workflow_runs()`: Find relevant CI runs
- `download_artifact()`: Download specific artifacts
- `extract_and_sync()`: Extract and copy files
- `verify_sync()`: Validate data freshness

#### 3. Multiple Sync Strategies
```bash
python sync_feast_data.py --daily    # Once per day
python sync_feast_data.py --weekly   # Once per week  
python sync_feast_data.py --latest   # On-demand
```

#### 4. Automation Script (`daily_sync.sh`)
```bash
#!/bin/bash
python sync_feast_data.py --daily
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    # Auto-train if data is fresh and sufficient
    python training_pipeline.py
fi
```

## 📊 Technical Architecture

### Data Flow
```
GitHub Actions Runner
    ↓ (hourly)
    Collect AQI data
    ↓
    Append to parquet
    ↓
    Upload as artifact
    ↓ (stored 30 days)
    
Local Machine
    ↓ (daily)
    Download artifact
    ↓
    Extract and sync
    ↓
    Verify data freshness
    ↓ (optional)
    Train models
```

### Sync Strategies Comparison
| Strategy | Frequency | Data Loss | Maintenance | Use Case |
|----------|-----------|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Daily | Once/day | Max 24h | Low | Development |
| Weekly | Once/week | Max 7d | Very Low | Learning |
| On-demand | As needed | Variable | Manual | Testing |
